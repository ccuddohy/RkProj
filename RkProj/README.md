Tutorial exercise using ASP.net core, SQL Server and Entity Framework.

#### Goals
* To become more familiar with SSQ Server and Entity Framework
* To get familiar with Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio
* To get more exercise with ASP.net.

#### Comments
* It was interesting to run into issues using the Server Management Studio and dig into the problem. The issues
I saw were apparently related to quirks with login rights and the different authentication methods. The exceptions
were not descriptive and incomplete. Looking at the event log helped to show what the actual issues were.
